 * [new branch]      sync-test  -> origin/sync-test
Spiegle Branch: main
Everything up-to-date
Spiegle Branch: sync-test
error: The destination you provided is not a full refname (i.e.,
starting with "refs/"). We tried to guess what you meant by:

- Looking for a ref that matches 'sync-test' on the remote side.
- Checking if the <src> being pushed ('refs/remotes/origin/sync-test')
  is a ref in "refs/{heads,tags}/". If so we add a corresponding
  refs/{heads,tags}/ prefix on the remote side.

Neither worked, so we gave up. You must fully qualify the ref.
hint: The <src> part of the refspec is a commit object.
hint: Did you mean to create a new branch by pushing to
hint: 'refs/remotes/origin/sync-test:refs/heads/sync-test'?
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://zbm.cloud.itz.in.bund.de/scm/repo/zbm/zbm-adapter-bsdd'
